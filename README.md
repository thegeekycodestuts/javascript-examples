The repository is organized into directories, each focusing on a specific topic or concept. Here are some of the topics you can explore:

-   **String Manipulation:** Discover how to work with strings, including substring extraction, searching, and formatting.

-   **DOM Manipulation:** Learn how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

-   **Event Handling:** Explore event-driven programming by handling various events, such as clicks, key presses, and form submissions.

-   **AJAX and Fetch:** Dive into asynchronous programming with examples of making API requests and handling responses.

-   **ES6 Features:** Explore the modern features of JavaScript introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) for cleaner and more efficient code.

## Usage

Each example is contained within its own directory and comes with a detailed explanation in the form of comments. To explore an example:

1. Navigate to the relevant directory based on the topic you're interested in.
2. Open the JavaScript file to view the code and comments explaining the example.
3. Experiment with the code by copying it into your own projects or using browser developer tools.

Feel free to adapt and integrate these examples into your own projects. Learning by doing is a great way to solidify your understanding of JavaScript.
